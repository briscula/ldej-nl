Found out in 2014 while in beta

In the meantime I switched from @gmail.com to @ldej.nl

IMAP export/import for 1.7 GB took 10 hours. Gmail doesn't store mails as usual. So your inbox is a combination of "Gmail/Important" and mails you have marked as read. Your "Inbox" is a from when Google introduced the smart "Important" email filtering, so a couple of years ago. So after importing you need to re-organize your inbox to show your inbox as it was in Gmail.

Gmail knows everything about you and can make a good prediction of the emails that are important to you. ProtonMail can't, so every email means a notification. It means you need to manage your email even better to get a similar experience.

Adding custom domain name.

Limited number of @ldej.nl e-mail addresses, but TransIP does the catch-all.

Android app:

- Always lags behind, often mails marked as read in browser are not marked as read on app.
- After adding a custom sender (info@ldej.nl), clear cache and storage, log in again, and then you are able to send from your customer address.
- Grouping of mails not possible.
