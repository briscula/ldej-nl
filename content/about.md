I'm a software engineer originally from The Netherlands and currently residing in [Gurgaon, India](https://goo.gl/maps/MpRDM4sYJ5KAHqtLA). I've completed my Master of Computing Science in 2015 at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/masters/computing-science/?lang=en), The Netherlands.

My homepage says I'm a full stack developer but to be honest, I feel most comfortable as a backend developer. For around 8 years Python was my go-to language, but for the past 3 years I've been working mostly in Go. I've done some C, C++ and Scala as well, oh and of course Java in the distant past, but I'd rather stay away from that. Javascript seems to be part of every developers resume nowadays, so I'll mention it too. I don't understand 'which' Javascript as every project seems to be picking a different set of libraries. I've worked with both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

You can find my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurencedejong/).

What I find the most important as a software developer is a great developer experience. An environment in which you can independently experiment, get feedback quickly and where you can focus on writing great software. For me that means developing a Cloud Native solution with managed hosted services for all non-core-business functionality like search and databases. I also love automated tests, formatting and linting and a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. Having setup and worked with all these productivity increasing tools, I cannot imagine how one can live without them.

Software Engineering and Distributed Systems is the specialization I chose for my Masters. For my thesis I've investigated how to create a decentralized link sharing system (a.k.a. [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/golang)). I've learned a ton about Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), blockchains and distributed messaging protocols. I'm trying to stay up-to-date but there is so much going on. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is a project which I have followed ever since.

In my spare time I love being a coach at [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org). It is such a great feeling to help people discover the magic of being able to create software.
