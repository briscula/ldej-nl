I'm a software engineer from The Netherlands. I've completed my Master of Computing Science in 2015 at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/masters/computing-science/?lang=en), The Netherlands.

I feel most comfortable as a backend developer. For around 8 years Python was my go-to language, but for the past 5 years I've been working mostly in Go. I've worked with Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and Azure.

What I find the most important as a software developer is a great developer experience. An environment in which you can independently experiment, get feedback quickly and where you can focus on writing great software. For me, that means developing a Cloud Native solution with managed services for all non-core-business functionality. I also love automated tests and CI/CD pipelines. Once you have worked on a project with full test coverage, you experience the freedom of refactoring and experimenting. If you go back to a project without full test coverage, you feel the pain.

Software Engineering and Distributed Systems is the specialization I chose for my Masters. For my thesis I've investigated how to create a decentralized link sharing system (a.k.a. [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/golang)). I've learned a ton about Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), blockchains and distributed messaging protocols. I'm trying to stay up-to-date but there is so much going on. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is a project which I follow ever since.

In my spare time I love being a coach at [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org). It is such a great feeling to help people discover the magic of being able to create software.
